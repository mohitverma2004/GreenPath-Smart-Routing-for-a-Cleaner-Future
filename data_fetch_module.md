# EcoRoute: Data Fetch Module Design

This document outlines the design for the Data Fetch Module, which is a core service in the EcoRoute backend. This module is responsible for communicating with external APIs to gather the data required for route calculations.

## 1. Overview

The Data Fetch Module will be implemented in `backend/app/services/data_fetch.py`. It will contain a collection of functions, each dedicated to fetching a specific type of data. This modular approach will make it easy to manage, test, and extend the data-fetching capabilities of the application.

## 2. Core Functions

The module will expose the following primary functions:

### `get_traffic_data(coordinates: list) -> dict`
-   **Purpose**: Fetches real-time traffic data for a given route or area.
-   **API**: TomTom API
-   **Input**: A list of coordinate pairs `(latitude, longitude)` defining the route.
-   **Output**: A dictionary containing traffic information, such as flow, incidents, and delays.
-   **Error Handling**: Will handle API errors, such as invalid keys or network issues, and return a default or cached value.

### `get_elevation_data(coordinates: list) -> dict`
-   **Purpose**: Retrieves elevation data for a set of geographical points.
-   **API**: Open-Elevation API
-   **Input**: A list of coordinate pairs.
-   **Output**: A dictionary mapping each coordinate to its elevation in meters. This will be crucial for calculating the `elevation` component of the eco-cost.
-   **Error Handling**: Will manage API rate limits and availability.

### `get_weather_data(location: tuple) -> dict`
-   **Purpose**: Fetches current weather conditions for a specific location.
-   **API**: A real-time weather API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap, AccuWeather).
-   **Input**: A single `(latitude, longitude)` tuple representing the general area of the route.
-   **Output**: A dictionary with weather parameters like wind speed, precipitation, and temperature, which will be used to calculate the `weatherImpact` cost.
-   **Error Handling**: Will handle cases where weather data is not available for a specific location.

### `get_charging_stations(bounding_box: dict) -> list`
-   **Purpose**: Finds EV charging stations within a given geographical area.
-   **API**: A public EV charging station API (e.g., Open Charge Map).
-   **Input**: A dictionary defining a bounding box with `min_latitude`, `min_longitude`, `max_latitude`, and `max_longitude`.
-   **Output**: A list of charging station objects, each containing details like location, connector types, and availability.
-   **Error Handling**: Will handle API-specific errors and return an empty list if no stations are found.

## 3. Data Caching

To improve performance and reduce the number of calls to external APIs, the results from these functions will be cached using Redis. The caching logic will be implemented in a separate utility or directly within these functions, with appropriate expiration times for each type of data (e.g., traffic data cached for a few minutes, elevation data for much longer).

## 4. Integration

The `RouteCalculationModule` will call these functions to gather the necessary data before running the routing algorithm. The data will be used to calculate the weights for each segment of the road network in the eco-cost function.
